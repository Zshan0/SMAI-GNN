# Testing GNN
To test the GNN code in this repo refer to [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IVivvmmAbNn7zHODAUel9GeVa4k6h2pQ?usp=sharing#scrollTo=XevCVhF11aUJ)
Note: I am cloning a different repo in the notebook. This is because I want to keep this code private so other teams cannot clone this repo before final project submission
The repo cloned is a mirror of this repo.
